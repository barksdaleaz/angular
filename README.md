# angular-bxaq2c

[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-bxaq2c)
A simple e-commerce app built w/Angular on StackBlitz following the [Angular tutorial](https://angular.io/start). 
Note: Four HTML files were mysteriously lost during push from StackBlitz to GitHub. Went back to recreate the HTML files.
